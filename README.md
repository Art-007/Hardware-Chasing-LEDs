This project includes: 
1. midterm.src code sources,  
   1. Main modules include delayed_led and m_counter module, along with modules to drive the 7-segment and thus all system. 
2. 500ms Simulation
3. 50ms Simulation with reset
4. Simulation with diffrent inputs, a reset and stop 
5. Initial schematic using draw.io
6. Vivado Block diagram 
7. Youtube video of the system implementation using the FPGA board
